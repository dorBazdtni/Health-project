# Health-project
This project documents my personal journey toward achieving a healthier lifestyle by monitoring key body metrics such as weight, muscle mass, body fat percentage, and BMI. The data-driven approach provides insights into how my exercise routines and dietary changes impact my progress over time.

I started on this journey after receiving a bad blood test result, which prompted me to switch to a healthier diet and increase my physical activity. By analyzing my body measurements and tracking trends, I aim to maintain my progress, refine my fitness strategy, and achieve a sustainable and healthier life.
